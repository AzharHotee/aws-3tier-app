# Citizen Feedback Service – 3-Tier AWS App (Stage 1 – Local)

This is a simple 3-tier style web application:

- Frontend: static HTML/JS in `frontend/`
- Backend: Node.js + Express API in `backend/`

Right now it runs locally. Next stages:

- Containerise backend
- Deploy to AWS (VPC, ALB, ECS/EC2, RDS)
- Add CI/CD and monitoring
